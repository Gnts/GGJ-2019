## Overstained!

This game was made in a weekend during Global Game Jam 2019. The theme was "What does home mean to you?"

Your home is a sacred space. Unfortunately, it is also a very filthy place. No matter how hard you try to clean, it seems to always get filthier. In this life simulation you must clean your home as fast as you are able, while managing the onslaught of filth building up in your humble abode.
